Installation procedure
----------------------

Even though the installation procedures below indicate that python-gnutls
works with python-2.4 or newer, we recommend that at least python-2.5 is
used, or even better python-2.6. This is because starting with python-2.5
python-ctypes was integrated in the standard python distribution and is no
longer required as a separate dependency.


1. Linux / UNIX

Build dependencies:
 - gcc
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.4)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 2.4.1)
 - the libgnutls dependencies (libgcrypt, libtasn1, libgpg-error, zlib)
 - python (>= 2.4)
 - python-ctypes (only when using python-2.4, othewrwise ctypes was
   integrated in python starting with version 2.5.0)

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install


2. Mac OS X

Build dependencies:
 - Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) or Snow Leopard (10.6)
 - Apple Developer Tools (XCode)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 2.4.1)
 - the libgnutls dependencies (libgcrypt, libtasn1, libgpg-error, zlib)
 - python (this is already preinstalled on every OS X)

Note: libgnutls and its dependencies can be installed from macports, fink or
by compiling and installing them from source.

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install


3. Windows

This was only tested on Windows XP. Other Windows versions may work, but
they were not tested.

Build dependencies:
 - Visual Studio (the version must match the one used to build the python
   interpreter that will be used. For example the python-2.6 windows
   binaries from python.org were built with Visual Studio 9)
 - libpthreads (http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32)
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.4) (select to include the development files
   when installing python)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 2.4.1).
 - the libgnutls dependencies: libgcrypt, libtasn1, libgpg-error, zlib.
   (they are automatically installed when installing libgnutls from the
   binary packages provided by gnutls.org)
 - libpthreads
 - python (>= 2.4)
 - python-ctypes (only when using python-2.4, othewrwise ctypes was
   integrated in python starting with version 2.5.0)

Before building python-gnutls, copy the pthread header files (pthread.h,
sched.h, semaphore.h) to C:\Developer\include\ and the pthread developer
libraries (libpthread*.a and pthread*.lib) to C:\Developer\lib\ (create
these directories first).
 
To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

In order to run an application based on python-gnutls, make sure that the
DLLs mentioned in the runtime dependencies (pthread*.dll, libgnutls*.dll,
etc) are somewhere in %PATH%


4. Cygwin

Build dependencies:
 - cygwin (>= 1.7.1)
 - gcc
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.5)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls26 (>= 2.4.1)
 - the libgnutls dependencies (libgcrypt11, libtasn1, libgpg-error, zlib)
   (they will be installed automatically when libgnutls26 is installed)
 - python (>= 2.5)

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install
