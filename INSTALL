Installation procedure
----------------------

1. Linux / UNIX

Build dependencies:
 - gcc
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.7)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 3.2.0)
 - libgnutls dependencies
 - python (>= 2.7)

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py install


2. Mac OS X

Build dependencies:
 - Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) or Snow Leopard (10.6)
 - Apple Developer Tools (XCode)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 3.2.0)
 - libgnutls dependencies
 - python (this is already preinstalled on every OS X)

Note: libgnutls and its dependencies can be installed from Homebre, MacPorts, Fink or
by compiling and installing them from source.

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py install


3. Windows

This was only tested on Windows XP. Other Windows versions may work, but
they were not tested.

Build dependencies:
 - Visual Studio (the version must match the one used to build the python
   interpreter that will be used. For example the python-2.7 windows
   binaries from python.org were built with Visual Studio 9)
 - libpthreads (http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32)
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.7) (select to include the development files
   when installing python)

Runtime dependencies:
 - libgnutls (>= 3.2)
 - libgnutls dependencies
 - libpthreads
 - python (>= 2.7)

Before building python-gnutls, copy the pthread header files (pthread.h,
sched.h, semaphore.h) to C:\Developer\include\ and the pthread developer
libraries (libpthread*.a and pthread*.lib) to C:\Developer\lib\ (create
these directories first).

To build and install python-gnutls run:

python setup.py install

In order to run an application based on python-gnutls, make sure that the
DLLs mentioned in the runtime dependencies (pthread*.dll, libgnutls*.dll,
etc) are somewhere in %PATH%


4. Cygwin

 - cygwin (>= 1.7.1)
 - gcc
 - python and python-dev (>= 2.7)

Runtime dependencies:
