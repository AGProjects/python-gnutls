This directory holds some examples of using python-gnutls. 

- An example of writing a synchronous client and server using the
  ClientSession and ServerSession classes from python-gnutls is
  given in client.py and server.py

- An example of writing an asynchronous client and server using the
  python-gnutls twisted interface is given in twisted-client.py and
  twisted-server.py

- An example of working with X509 certificates and their attributes
  as well as using a CRL to check their revocation is in crypto.py



To run the examples without installing python-gnutls, run the following
command prior to trying the examples (after python-gnutls was built):

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/python-gnutls
